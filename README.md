# TwubricTask

Deployed in https://arunprabak-twubric-task.netlify.com/

I have utilized few things to complete the task

## Bootstrap Css framework

## Modules 
      To utilize the routing Feature
      To import the material date picker
      
## Decorator
      `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators used for component interaction

## Structural directive
      `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` directives used for hiding and looping
      
## Services and Dependency Injection
       To fetch the data using HttpClientModule
       
## Lifecycle Hooks
       `ngOnInit()` used To initiate api Fetching
    
## Pipes
       pipes used for format the date
       
## Events and Attribute Binding
       Event binding and Attribute binding used to trigger the events and bind attributes to element
       
## ES6
      `sort` and `filter`, `Object.keys()`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
